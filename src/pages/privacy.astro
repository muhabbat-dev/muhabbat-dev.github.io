  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how this website (muhabbat.dev) collects, uses,
    and protects your information when you visit. This site is a personal
    portfolio and blog about coding, software engineering, and technology.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    When you visit this site, certain information may be collected
    automatically, such as your IP address, browser type, operating system,
    referring pages, and the date and time of your visit. This data is collected
    mainly for analytics and security purposes.

  <p>
    If you contact me directly (via contact form or email), I may collect your
    name, email address, and the content of your message.
  </p>

  <h2>Cookies and Analytics</h2>
  <p>
    This site may use cookies and similar technologies to improve user
    experience, track traffic, and analyze how content is used. Analytics tools
    (such as Google Analytics or similar) may collect anonymous usage data like
    page views and time spent on the site.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can disable cookies in your browser settings, but some parts of the site
    may not function correctly.
  </p>

  <h2>Use of Information</h2>
  <p>Collected information may be used to:</p>

    <li>Understand which topics are most useful to readers</li>
    <li>Respond to messages or inquiries you send</li>
    <li>Protect against spam, abuse, or security risks</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>AI-Generated Content</h2>
  <p>
    Some blog posts are written with the assistance of artificial intelligence.
    High-quality prompts are used to generate clear, accurate, and useful
    articles for readers. All content is reviewed and edited before publishing
    to ensure quality and readability.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    This website may use trusted third-party providers for hosting, analytics,
    or similar services. These providers may process limited information on my
    behalf to operate and improve the website. They are not allowed to use this
    data for other purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Retention and Security</h2>
  <p>
    Personal data provided through contact forms or email will only be kept as
    long as necessary to respond to your request. Analytics data is stored by
    third-party providers (e.g., Google Analytics) according to their retention
    policies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reasonable measures are taken to protect collected data, but no website or
    online service can be 100% secure.
  </p>

    This website is not directed at children under 16. No personal information
    is knowingly collected from children. If you believe your child has shared
    information here, please contact me to have it removed.

    practices of other sites. Please review their policies separately.

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated occasionally. Updates will be posted on
    this page with a new “Last updated” date. Continued use of the site after
