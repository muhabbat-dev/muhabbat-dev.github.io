In this post, I will create a small web app using react.js to create your own HTML, CSS, and Javascript code editor using the the library codemirror.

# How to start

Before getting started make sure you have initialized your React project using vite

## Install Libraries

I will **@uiw/react-codemirror** library. This library is used to build code editors with great features, such as theme, light / dark mode, language support, etc. However, we need to install many a dependency to add these functionalities.

```jsx
yarn add @uiw/react-codemirror
```

This library supports many programming languages with intelligence support. However, you have to install each language support separately. For this tutorial, I’m using Javascript language for the editor

```jsx
yarn add @codemirror/lang-javascript
```

You can also add the syntax support of other language

Here is a list of a few dependencies supporting different languages.

- @codemirror/lang-html
- @codemirror/lang-css
- @codemirror/lang-python
- @codemirror/lang-cpp
- @codemirror/lang-php
- @codemirror/lang-sql
- @codemirror/lang-json
- @codemirror/lang-xml
- @codemirror/lang-java
- @codemirror/lang-markdown
- @codemirror/lang-rust

**and the following languages under legacy support**

- @codemirror/legacy-modes/mode/haskel
- @codemirror/legacy-modes/mode/julia
- @codemirror/legacy-modes/mode/brainfuck
- @codemirror/legacy-modes/mode/clojure
- @codemirror/legacy-modes/mode/cobol
- @codemirror/legacy-modes/mode/coffeescript
- @codemirror/legacy-modes/mode/go
- @codemirror/legacy-modes/mode/cypher
- @codemirror/legacy-modes/mode/erlang
- @codemirror/legacy-modes/mode/fortran
- @codemirror/legacy-modes/mode/hasket
- and many more…

Let’s add the code now

Create a component CodeEditor

```javascript
import ReactCodeMirror from "@uiw/react-codemirror";
import { javascript } from "@codemirror/lang-javascript";

function CodeEditor() {
  return (
    <div className="editor">
      <h1>Code editor</h1>
      <ReactCodeMirror
        value={"console.log('Hello');"}
        height="200px"
        extensions={[javascript({ jsx: true })]}
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default CodeEditor;
```

The value prop is the code string that you want to display on the editor

## Theme

This library also provides a lot of themes for your editor.

You can use these themes by installing their dependency

```javascript
yarn add @uiw/codemirror-theme-okaidia
```

```javascript
import { okaidia } from "@uiw/codemirror-theme-okaidia"
.......

<ReactCodeMirror
.......
theme={okaidia}
/>
```

## Using Custom Theme

You can even define your custom themes with your desired color-scheme. For adding custom themes, You need two more libraries to define your theme. Here is the example

```javascript
yarn add @uiw/codemirror-themes @lezer/highlight
```

Create a theme.js file

```javascript
import { createTheme } from "@uiw/codemirror-themes";
import { tags as t } from "@lezer/highlight";

export const myTheme = createTheme({
  theme: "light",
  settings: {
    background: "#ffffff",
    foreground: "#75baff",
    caret: "#5d00ff",
    selection: "#036dd626",
    selectionMatch: "#036dd626",
    lineHighlight: "#8a91991a",
    gutterBackground: "#fff",
    gutterForeground: "#8a919966",
  },
  styles: [
    { tag: t.comment, color: "#787b8099" },
    { tag: t.variableName, color: "#0080ff" },
    { tag: [t.string, t.special(t.brace)], color: "#5c6166" },
    { tag: t.number, color: "#5c6166" },
    { tag: t.bool, color: "#5c6166" },
    { tag: t.null, color: "#5c6166" },
    { tag: t.keyword, color: "#5c6166" },
    { tag: t.operator, color: "#5c6166" },
    { tag: t.className, color: "#5c6166" },
    { tag: t.definition(t.typeName), color: "#5c6166" },
    { tag: t.typeName, color: "#5c6166" },
    { tag: t.angleBracket, color: "#5c6166" },
    { tag: t.tagName, color: "#5c6166" },
    { tag: t.attributeName, color: "#5c6166" },
  ],
});
```

Now you can pass this theme in your CodeEditor prop just like you did for themes library themes

![](/src/assets/images/body/2024/11/2024-06-11-build-your-own-code-editor-body.png)

Now you have implemented your IDE for writing code. You can add two more components for CSS, and JavaScript if you want to create 3 code screens like codepen.io
