With its highly intuitive user interface, N8n allows individuals and businesses to create complex workflows by visually interconnecting applications and services.

## Why Use N8n?

N8n is more than just an automation tool; it is a catalyst for efficiency and creativity in workflows. Here are a few compelling reasons to consider using N8n for your automation needs:
